\section{Introduction}

The aim of this project is to examine the product particles of various meson
decays, in particular $B$, $D$ and $\psi(3770)$ decays. To this end, the
invariant mass distributions of three decay chains were examined:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two body $\psi(3770) \rightarrow D^0 \xbar{D^0}$,
    \item Three body $B^+ \rightarrow D^0 \xbar{D^0} K^+$, and
    \item Four body $D^0 \rightarrow K^+ K^- K^- \pi^+$
\end{enumerate}

In addition, the decay angles between the resulting particles in the lab frame
were examined for the following decays:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\psi(3770) \rightarrow D^0 \xbar{D^0}$ and
    \item $B \rightarrow \left\{ \psi(3770) \rightarrow D^0 \xbar{D^0} \right\} K$
\end{enumerate}

Investigate the invariant mass distributions of the product particles of three decays:\r\n\r\n  * ![equation](.eqns/psi.png)\r\n  * ![equation](.eqns/BPlus.png)\r\n  * ![equation](.eqns/D0.png)\r\n\r\n2. Investigate the decay angles between product pairs in the following two decays:\r\n\r\n  * ![equation](.eqns/psi.png)\r\n  * ![equation](.eqns/B.png)\r\n\r\nThese results demonstrate that the decay angle of the decays is sufficiently\r\nsharply peaked to be used as a discriminator from the background.\r\n\r\nIt can therefore be used to distinguish the ![equation](.eqns/psi.png)\r\ndecays for use in symmetry violation studies such as those measuring the strong\r\nphase information of the decay.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

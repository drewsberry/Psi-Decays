Psi-Decays
==========

This code represents the work of my summer internship in 2013.
The purpose of this code is two-part:

1. Investigate the invariant mass distributions of the product particles of three decays:

  * ![equation](.eqns/psi.png)
  * ![equation](.eqns/BPlus.png)
  * ![equation](.eqns/D0.png)

2. Investigate the decay angles between product pairs in the following two decays:

  * ![equation](.eqns/psi.png)
  * ![equation](.eqns/B.png)

These results demonstrate that the decay angle of the decays is sufficiently
sharply peaked to be used as a discriminator from the background.

It can therefore be used to distinguish the ![equation](http://bit.ly/1aagay2)
decays for use in symmetry violation studies such as those measuring the strong
phase information of the decay.
